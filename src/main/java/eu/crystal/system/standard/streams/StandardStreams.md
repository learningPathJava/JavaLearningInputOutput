# Standard Streams
## Predefined streams

Java defines three predefined streams or standard streams.
- System.in	
    - This is the standard stream for input. 
    - This stream is used for reading data for the program.
- System.out
    - This is the standard stream for output. 
    - This stream is used for writing data from the program to an output device such as a monitor or to some file.
- System.err
    - This is a standard stream for error. 
    - This is used to show an error message on the screen to the users.

System.in is an object of InputStream. 

System.out and System.err are both an object of type PrintStream.
